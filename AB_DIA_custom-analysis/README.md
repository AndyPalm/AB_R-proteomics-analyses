Built in R 4.4.2

Takes the "model qc" output from MSstats and visualizes the intensity distributions by comparisons.

Can break out subsets of proteins (e.g. cell surface, ER) and plot the distribution of proteins that match those annotations and compare it to total intensity distribution or the distribution of proteins that don't match the subset.

Plots histograms inverted - e.g. subset on top (+ direction), and other/total proteins on bottom (in – direction)
